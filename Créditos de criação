How to make the bio gif ?
ðŸ’œ Thanks to [matyo91](https://github.com/matyo91)
I made my with https://codesandbox.io/s/github-profile-2ijk7
Then i recorded my screen to gif on Mac with Quicktime  and save result to [assets/github.mov](assets/github.mov)
This [GIF converter](https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif) help me to create a dedicated command that convert MOV to GIF.
Then i save result to [assets/github.gif](assets/github.gif)
